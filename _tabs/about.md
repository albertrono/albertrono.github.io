# 👋 Hey there, I'm Albert Rono

I’m a **Software Engineering student** at **Multimedia University of Kenya (MMU)** — and a firm believer that curiosity is the spark behind every great idea.

My tech journey started the moment I wrote my first `Hello World` in HTML.  
That simple line opened a door I’ve never wanted to close since. What began as curiosity quickly turned into a passion for **creating, solving problems, and understanding how things work under the hood**.

---

## 🚀 From Curiosity to Code

In 2022, I joined **eMobilis Mobile Training Institute**, where I dove into **Full Stack Development** — learning to build and break things (and fix them again).  
That’s where I realized that programming isn’t just about syntax or tools; it’s about creativity, logic, and persistence.

Later, my curiosity led me deeper into **data** — how it moves, how it tells stories, and how it drives decisions.  
This interest came alive during my **Data Analyst internship at Safra Data**, where I got hands-on experience working with real datasets and transforming them into meaningful insights.

## 💼 What I Do

**Data Analyst Intern — Safra Data (2024 & 2025)**  
At Safra Data, I:  
- Collected, cleaned, and analyzed operational datasets for weekly and daily reporting.  
- Built **interactive dashboards** in Power BI and Excel to help teams track KPIs and performance trends.  
- Collaborated across departments to turn data into clear, actionable insights.  
- Improved data presentation workflows, making information easier to understand and use.

Each project taught me something new — not just about tools like Power BI or Python, but about how *clarity and curiosity* can make a real impact.

## 🧠 Skills and Tools

- **Languages:** Python, Golang, PHP, SQL  
- **Libraries & Tools:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Power BI  
- **Concepts:** Data Analysis, Object-Oriented Programming, Web Development  
- **Currently Exploring:** Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning  

I enjoy building things that make sense — whether that’s an analysis pipeline, a simple web app, or a system that helps people make better decisions.

## 🌿 How I See Tech

I see technology as a form of storytelling.  
Every dataset, every system, and every line of code carries meaning — and when understood properly, it can shape smarter ideas, better systems, and stronger communities.

That’s why I’m drawn to **data-driven development** — it combines logic and creativity, and that balance keeps me excited about what’s next.

---

## ✨ Outside the Code

Outside the world of brackets and dashboards, I’m just someone who enjoys learning, reflecting, and creating.  
I like exploring ideas, meeting curious minds, and finding connections between technology and everyday life.

I also host *Ancestor’s Pod*, where I share conversations, humor, and reflections on life — because I believe wisdom should always have a voice (and a laugh).
