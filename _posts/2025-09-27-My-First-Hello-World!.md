## My First Hello World!

Hey there, Ancestor (I‚Äôll tell you why I like this name),

My name is **Albert Rono**, a Software Engineering student at **Multimedia University of Kenya (MMU)**.  

However, this story starts four years ago. So, hold your tray tables up and let‚Äôs roll back to January 2022. Remember COVID? The pandemic hit hard, and it even messed with the school calendar a bit. I was supposed to finish high school in December 2021, but with the break, I ended up finishing in April 2022.

I went into the exam room not particularly knowing what career I wanted to pursue. I believed that the grade I would get would somehow decide my fate.

Fast forward to April, and I find myself with a letter to an institution I had only heard about. On a random Sunday, I left at midnight for the city, about 300 km away from home. The first stop was **Westlands**, just outside the mall. Had I ever been to town? No. But there I was, walking to the **Kipro Center** with all my luggage ‚Äî excited, lost, and hopeful.

That‚Äôs how I began my studies at **eMobilis Mobile Institute**, where I took on **Full Stack Mobile Development**.  
On Tuesday, I wrote my **first-ever line of code**. Nothing fancy ‚Äî it was just HTML.  
But that small `<h1>Hello World!</h1>` changed everything for me. It was the spark that lit up my curiosity, my love for building, and my desire to grow in tech.

Looking back, I appreciate the journey ‚Äî the long nights, the bugs, and the small victories. I‚Äôve learned that growth doesn‚Äôt happen all at once. It happens one commit, one error, one solved problem at a time.
